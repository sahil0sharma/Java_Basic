    THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE FILE

        let assume we have a java file
        --> test.java

         1)--This java file will first compile by --> javac
            |> javac convert code into  machine code ( platform independent )
            |> platform independent means it can run in mac, window , linux systems also
         2)--Then its gets interpretation( line by line ) by JVM ( Java virtual machine )
            |> JVM interpretates the bytecode into machine code( platform dependent )
            |> Machine code in bytes

    1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

    JVM = Runs your compiled Java code.
    Core jobs->
    Converts bytecode → machine code
    Executes the program
    Manages memory (heap/stack, garbage collection)
    Loads classes

    You can’t write Java with just JVM.
    You can only run Java programs with it.

    2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

    JRE = JVM + libraries needed to run Java
    Contains:
    JVM
    Core Java libraries
    Runtime files
    we use JRE to run Java apps.
    we cannot compile Java code with it.

    JRE = JVM + standard classes
    JVM = execution engine only

    3. JDK (Java Development Kit)

    JDK = JRE + tools for developers.
    Contains:
    JRE
    JVM
    Compiler (javac)
    Debugge
    Packaging tools

    If you want to write Java, compile Java, or build apps → you need JDK.
