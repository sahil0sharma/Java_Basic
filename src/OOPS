          POP                       OOP                      Functional                 Declarative
   Procedure Oriented         Object Oriented
      Programning               Programing



POP--> In this programing everyting is function and a Gloabal data is shared across functions
        security is very low
        not for large programs

OOP--> In this programing we deal with objects that mirriors real life
       eg:- a doctor, a box, a teacher, a person;

    Properties :-

                   1) ENSACAPSUALATION :- Wrapping the data member and member funtion into single entity
                                        Like - class, methods

                   2) INHERITANCE :- Taking properties of parent class into child class

                   3) POLYMORPHISM :- More than one form
                                      Handeling different types of work and objects
                                                        or
                                      Handeling different types of data member or methods with one system

                   4) CLASS :- Class is a blueprint or structure that have data and methods for that object

                   5) OBJECT :- Object is an actual instance of that class that represent actul entity of that class

                   6) For class no memory is allocated it is logical thing

                   7) Analogy for object and class :-  Map of house is class
                                                       Actual house is object
